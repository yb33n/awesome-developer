# The Internet In a Nutshell

The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that has revolutionized how we communicate, access information, and conduct business. At its core, it's a vast system that allows data to be transmitted between devices anywhere in the world.

## Key Components

1. **Infrastructure**: The physical layer of the Internet.
    - Fiber optic cables (e.g., transatlantic cables like MAREA)
    - Satellite networks (e.g., Starlink)
    - Cellular networks (4G, 5G)
    - Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)

2. **Protocols**: Standardized rules for data communication.
    - TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)

3. **Servers**: High-performance computers that store, process, and distribute data.
    - Web servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
    - Database servers (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
    - Application servers (e.g., Tomcat, Node.js)

4. **Clients**: End-user devices that request and receive data.
    - Desktop computers, smartphones, IoT devices

## Key Concepts

### 1. IP Address

A numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

- **IPv4**: 32-bit address space (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- **IPv6**: 128-bit address space (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)

```
IPv4: 192.168.1.1
IPv6: 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334 (compressed form)
```

### 2. Domain

Human-readable names mapped to IP addresses through the Domain Name System.

- **Structure**: `[subdomain.]domain.TLD`
- **Example**: `www.example.com`
    - `www` - subdomain
    - `example` - second-level domain
    - `com` - Top-Level Domain (TLD)

### 3. URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

A reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it.

- **Structure**: `scheme:[//[user:password@]host[:port]][/]path[?query][#fragment]`
- **Example**: `https://api.example.com:8080/v1/users?active=true#info`
    - `https://` - scheme
    - `api.example.com` - host
    - `:8080` - port
    - `/v1/users` - path
    - `?active=true` - query
    - `#info` - fragment

### 4. Protocol

A set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices.

- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems
- **FTP**: Standard network protocol used for file transfer between a client and server
- **SMTP**: Internet standard for email transmission

### 5. DNS (Domain Name System)

A hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network.

- **Process**:
    1. User enters "www.example.com" in browser
    2. Recursive DNS resolver queries root nameserver
    3. Root server responds with TLD nameserver (.com)
    4. TLD nameserver provides authoritative nameserver for example.com
    5. Authoritative nameserver returns IP address for www.example.com
    6. Resolver returns IP address to client
    7. Client establishes connection with the IP address

```shell
dig +trace www.example.com
```

This command demonstrates the DNS resolution process, showing each step from root to authoritative nameserver.
