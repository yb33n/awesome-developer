# Understanding `#!/usr/bin/env node` and What Is Shebang or Hashbang

This line of code is known as a "shebang" or "hashbang":

```
#!/usr/bin/env node
```

## What is a Shebang/Hashbang?

A shebang (also called hashbang) is a special comment used as an interpreter directive in script files. It's typically the first line of a script and tells the system which interpreter should be used to execute the script.

## Breaking Down the Shebang

1. `#!`: This is the shebang notation.
2. `/usr/bin/env`: This is a command used to locate and execute programs.
3. `node`: This specifies that the Node.js interpreter should be used.

## Purpose and Function

This shebang line serves several purposes:

1. It identifies the file as a Node.js script.
2. It instructs the system to use the Node.js interpreter to execute the script.
3. It allows the script to be run directly from the command line (after making the file executable).

## Why Use `/usr/bin/env`?

Using `/usr/bin/env` instead of directly specifying the path to Node.js (like `#!/usr/bin/node`) offers better portability:

- It searches for the `node` executable in the user's PATH.
- This approach works across different systems where Node.js might be installed in various locations.

## Usage Context

- This shebang is commonly used in Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS).
- It's typically ignored on Windows systems.
- It's particularly useful for creating executable Node.js scripts or command-line tools.

## Example Usage

After adding this shebang and making your script executable, you can run it directly:

```bash
chmod +x your-script.js
./your-script.js
```

This allows your Node.js script to behave like any other executable command on Unix-like systems.
